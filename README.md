# control-volume-using-hands
In this project we are going to control laptop volume using python and open_cv.
landmarks of a hand will be detected and using math library, math.hypot() method returns the Euclidean norm.The Euclidian norm is the distance from the origin to the coordinates.

using this we are going to adjust the laptop volume whether to increase or decrease volume.
